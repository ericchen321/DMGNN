# Motion Saving

## Save Motion on Testing
Make sure in your testing config file, `save_motion` is set to `True`. After evaluation you should be able to find `.npy` files with paths like this:
```
/home/eric/eece571f/DMGNN/cmu-short_no-diff_masked/work_dir/prediction/test/test/test/test/test/motions_exp0/motions_<action type>_<inputs/outputs/targets>.npy
```
